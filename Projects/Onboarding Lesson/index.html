      <h3 class="card-title">Gaming</h3>
      <p class="card-text">I've always loved video games. I spent a lot of my childhood playing games at a friend's house. Nowadays, it's mostly single player RPGs or multiplayer in a chat party with actual friends.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Schooling</h3>
      <p class="card-text">I attended the University of Florida. Due to switching majors from Chemistry to Criminology in my second year, I was lucky enough to graduate in 3 and a half years.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Movies</h3>
      <p class="card-text">I absolutely love watching movies. Sci-fi movies are typically my favorites but I also love war movies and comedies. I have a decent collection of Blu-Rays on my bookshelf. My favorite movie of all time is Saving Private Ryan.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Food</h3>
      <p class="card-text">I love eating food even though some would argue that I don't have a wide enough variety. I'm not exactly the healthiest of eaters, but I was also blessed with a high metabolism. I have a really big sweet tooth and love almost all candy.</p>
